# News AI Pipeline Tutorial Notebooks

This directory contains tutorial notebooks that demonstrate the medallion architecture pipeline used in this project.

## Core Pipeline Notebooks

1. `01_bronze_layer_tutorial.ipynb` - Learn how to process raw data into the Bronze layer
2. `02_silver_layer_tutorial.ipynb` - Feature engineering processes to create the Silver layer
3. `03_silicon_layer_tutorial.ipynb` - Advanced metrics modeling in the Silicon layer
4. `04_gold_layer_tutorial.ipynb` - Integrating metrics for recommendation models

## How to Use

These notebooks provide step-by-step guidance through:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Feature engineering techniques
- Training specialized metrics models
- Visualization and evaluation
- Integration into a complete pipeline

For the full processing pipeline, use the scripts in `ml_pipeline/workflows`.
